This project is my ideal vision of a European football format which combines domestic and European fixtures into one massive tournament. The project has undergone several iterations.

The current format allows three types of fixture creation:

-Domestic fixtures: All teams play other teams from their own country

-Hybrid fixtures: Top teams from each league play teams from another country, the rest play domestic fixtures

-Finale fixtures: Only teams a certain number of points away from the combined standings leader or domestic standings leader play.
